Unbound (static defined on same level as entity set)
Bound
    * Bound to entity
    * Bound to singleton
    * Bound to entity set
    * No inputs
    * 1 input
    * 2 inputs
    * returns single primititve
    * returns single complex
    * returns single enum
    * returns collection
    * - client side: primitive input (Get("hi"))
    * - client side: complex input (Get({x: 7})) Parameter values passed to functions MUST be specified either as a URL literal (for primitive values) or as a JSON formatted OData object (for complex values, or collections of primitive or complex values). Entity typed values are passed as JSON formatted entities that MAY include a subset of the properties, or just the entity reference, as appropriate to the function.   
        - input as entity
        - input as complex type which is exculsive to this function
    * - client side: colleciton input (Get([{x: 7}])) Parameter values passed to functions MUST be specified either as a URL literal (for primitive values) or as a JSON formatted OData object (for complex values, or collections of primitive or complex values). Entity typed values are passed as JSON formatted entities that MAY include a subset of the properties, or just the entity reference, as appropriate to the function.   
    * - client side: server side value inpout (Get(my/greeting))
    * Overloaded functions
    * Composeable functions /func1()/func2()
    * what happens if the function has a param named "bindingParameter"
    * how does the whitelist behave with unbound and collection bound functions
